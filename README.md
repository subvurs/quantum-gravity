## PRE-PRINT NOTICE

**This work has not yet undergone formal peer review.** The research is being shared openly to facilitate community engagement and scientific discussion.

### Important Clarifications:

1. **Experimental Scope**: The experimental results (576+ tests) were conducted on quantum computing hardware across three independent platforms (Rigetti Ankaa-3, IBM Torino, IBM Brisbane). The connection between quantum circuit behavior and Planck-scale physics is a **theoretical interpretation** proposed by this framework.

2. **Reproducibility**: All quantum hardware experiments are independently verifiable. **Task/Job IDs can be requested for result confirmation** via quantum provider APIs. Contact information below.

3. **Testable Predictions**: This framework makes six specific, falsifiable predictions for astrophysical observations (gravitational waves, gamma-ray dispersion, black hole shadows, etc.) that can be tested with current or near-future technology.

4. **Community Feedback**: Scientific critique, questions, and feedback are actively welcomed through GitHub Issues or direct contact.

## About

This repository contains the Binary Hive Quantum Gravity framework, a novel approach to quantum gravity that proposes spacetime emerges from 256-state quantum information systems at the Planck scale. The framework is grounded in extensive quantum hardware experiments and makes specific, testable predictions for astrophysical observations.

The theory connects quantum circuit behavior to gravitational phenomena through empirically discovered universal constants and provides potential explanations for dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmological constant problem.
