## ⚠️ PRE-PRINT NOTICE

**This work has not yet undergone formal peer review.** The research is being shared openly to facilitate community engagement and scientific discussion.

### Important Clarifications:

1. **Experimental Scope**: The experimental results (576+ tests) were conducted on quantum computing hardware across three independent platforms (Rigetti Ankaa-3, IBM Torino, IBM Brisbane). The connection between quantum circuit behavior and Planck-scale physics is a **theoretical interpretation** proposed by this framework.

2. **Reproducibility**: All quantum hardware experiments are independently verifiable. **Task/Job IDs can be requested for result confirmation** via quantum provider APIs. Contact information below.

3. **Testable Predictions**: This framework makes six specific, falsifiable predictions for astrophysical observations (gravitational waves, gamma-ray dispersion, black hole shadows, etc.) that can be tested with current or near-future technology.

4. **Community Feedback**: Scientific critique, questions, and feedback are actively welcomed through GitHub Issues or direct contact.

**Note**: Task IDs and job IDs have been sanitized from these public documents to protect experimental infrastructure. However, **all Task/Job IDs are available upon request** for independent verification of results via quantum provider APIs (IBM Quantum, AWS Braket). Please open a GitHub Issue or contact us directly to request specific Task IDs for result confirmation.
