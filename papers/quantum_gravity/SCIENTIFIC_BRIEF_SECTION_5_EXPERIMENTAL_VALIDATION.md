### 5.6 Limitations and Reproducibility

**Acknowledged Limitations:**

1. **Single research group:** All experiments conducted by one team. Independent replication not yet performed.

2. **Quantum circuit regime:** Tests on 21-82 qubit systems, not actual Planck-scale measurements. Connection to fundamental spacetime structure is theoretical inference.

3. **Limited astrophysical validation:** Predictions (GW harmonics, dispersion, etc.) not yet tested with telescope/detector data.

4. **Hardware constraints:** Largest system tested = 82 qubits (Rigetti Ankaa-3). Scaling beyond 100 qubits not yet validated.

5. **Pattern interpretation:** Alternative explanations for 256-pattern organization may exist.

**Reproducibility Requirements:**

All experiments are reproducible given:
- Cloud access to IBM Quantum or Amazon Braket (Rigetti)
- Task IDs provided for verification
- Code available in research repository
- Standard quantum computing libraries (Qiskit, PyQuil)

**Next Steps for Community Validation:**
1. Independent replication by other research groups
2. Cross-platform validation (Google, IonQ, etc.)
3. Scaling tests beyond 100 qubits
4. Astrophysical data analysis (LIGO, Fermi, EHT)

**Data Availability:** All 491+ task IDs documented. Results retrievable via quantum cloud platforms for verification period (typically 90 days, some archived longer).
