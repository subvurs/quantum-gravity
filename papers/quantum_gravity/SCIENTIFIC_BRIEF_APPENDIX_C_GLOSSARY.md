## Appendix C: Glossary of Terms

**Purpose:** This appendix defines key terms, concepts, and notation used throughout the scientific brief.

## C.1 Core Concepts

**Binary Hive**
- A 256-state quantum information system (8 qubits, 2⁸ = 256 basis states) occupying one Planck volume
- Fundamental unit of spacetime in this framework
- Contains three functional pattern classes: observable (35%), dark matter routing (15%), dark energy processing (50%)
- Analogous to atoms in matter, but for information structure

**Pattern**
- One of 256 possible computational basis states of an 8-qubit system
- Labeled P0 through P255 (or using binary representation)
- Each pattern has distinct functional properties (entropy, routing capability, observability)
- Example: Pattern 51 (binary 0b110011), Pattern 100 (binary 0b1100100)

**Pattern Classes**
- **Observable Patterns (35%):** Directly measurable states that couple to computational/measurement processes; correspond to visible matter (5% of universe after observability scaling)
- **Dark Matter Patterns (15%):** Routing and information storage states with low entropy (2.79-2.85 bits) and high preservation (42-44%); form inter-hive coupling network
- **Dark Energy Patterns (50%):** High-entropy processing substrate; sparse activation (10⁻¹²² active fraction) creates cosmological constant

**Hive-to-Hive Coupling**
- Quantum informatic connection between adjacent hives in spacetime lattice
- Mediated by dark matter routing patterns
- Strength determined by coherence mismatch and universal constant μ = 1/13
- Variable coupling across lattice generates spacetime curvature
